<h1 id='purchase'>Purchase</h1>
<p>A <strong>Purchase</strong> is a single transaction between a buyer and seller. A single <a href="#listing">Listing</a> with multiple items for sale could have many Purchases related to it, one for each buyer.</p>

<p>A Purchase is a stage machine. </p>

<p>When a Listing is purchased, a new Purchase contract is created. In the simplest, success case, a Purchase moves through the following stages:</p>

<p><code>shipping_pending</code> → <code>buyer_pending</code> → <code>seller_pending</code> → <code>complete</code></p>

<p><em>You don&#39;t currently need to use this method currently. Purchases are fully funded when bought from Listings.</em></p>
